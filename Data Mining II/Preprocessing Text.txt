Text mining, also known as text data mining, is the process of deriving useful information from text. It involves cleaning the text, removing unnecessary words (like "the", "is", and "an"), and reducing words to their base form. For instance, words like "running" and "runner" can be reduced to "run". Additionally, removing punctuations such as commas, periods, and other symbols is essential. Text mining is widely used in applications such as sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and spam filtering. This process enhances the understanding of text-based data.
